## Why did I build this web app?
 
Last summer, my skin broke out for the first time. 
 
Since my first breakout, I spent a good amount of time finding and researching the right products to make my acne go away. It was irritating when the products that I bought would not work for my skin. After reading many reviews on Amazon and talking to my friends, I realized that I wasn’t the only person struggling to find the right skincare products. 
 
This is why I decided to build Bye Bye Acne, (originally) an iOS App that would help those suffering from acne like me (80% of the world aged between 11 to 30) save time in finding the right skincare products. 
 
Due to unforeseen circumstances, I unfortunately lost all the code for the iOS App before I could publish it to the app store.
 
I didn’t give up. Wanting to try something new, I decided to turn Bye Bye Acne from an iOS app into a web app. Here is the initial design for the app (built with Balsamiq)

For the implementation, I first played around with React, Redux, and Flask, but I settled down with plain old HTML, CSS, and JQuery to publish a quick prototype.
 
Here’s what the final product looks like:
